         >>> import rocks

We are actively developing ``rocks`` and `new versions
<https://github.com/maxmahlke/rocks/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_ come out
frequently. If you encounter a bug, a first step to resolve it is to
:ref:`clear your cache directory <cache_directory>` and to update to the latest
version using

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install -U space-rocks


.. _install_fzf:

Optional: Interactive Search
============================

``rocks`` provides an interactive search dialogue using the `fzf
<https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/>`_  fuzzy-finder which is triggered if
commands that expect an :term:`asteroid identifier<Identifier>` as argument are
called without argument.\ [#f1]_

The ``fzf`` tool needs to be installed separately from ``rocks``. On most
systems (Linux + MacOS), this requires a single command on the terminal, as
explained in the `fzf documentation
<https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/#installation>`_
